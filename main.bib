	abstract = {This is a study of the universality of spectral statistics for large random matrices. Considered are  symmetric, Hermitian, or quaternion self-dual random matrices with independent identically distributed entries (Wigner matrices), where the probability distribution of each matrix element is given by a measure  with zero expectation and with subexponential decay. The main result is that the correlation functions of the local eigenvalue statistics in the bulk of the spectrum coincide with those of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE), the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE), and the Gaussian Symplectic Ensemble (GSE), respectively, in the limit as . This approach is based on a study of the Dyson Brownian motion via a related new dynamics, the local relaxation flow. As a main input, it is established that the density of the eigenvalues converges to the Wigner semicircle law, and this holds even down to the smallest possible scale. Moreover, it is shown that the eigenvectors are completely delocalized. These results hold even without the condition that the matrix elements are identically distributed: only independence is used. In fact, for the matrix elements of the Green function strong estimates are given that imply that the local statistics of any two ensembles in the bulk are identical if the first four moments of the matrix elements match. Universality at the spectral edges requires matching only two moments. A Wigner-type estimate is also proved, and it is shown that the eigenvalues repel each other on arbitrarily small scales.

Expressions with a ratio α of clauses to variables less than a threshold αc are almost always satisfiable, whereas those with a ratio above this threshold are almost always unsatisfiable. We show the existence of an intermediate phase below αc, where the proliferation of metastable states is responsible for the onset of complexity in search algorithms. We introduce a class of optimization algorithms that can deal with these metastable states; one such algorithm has been tested successfully on the largest existing benchmark of K-satisfiability.},

The bounds demonstrate a gap between the Null- and Positivstellensatz refutations on one hand, and the polynomial calculus and Positivstellensatz calculus on the other."

abstract = "We investigate the representation of multivariate symmetric polynomials as sum of squares, as well as the effective computation of this decomposition. Since this task is solved using semidefinite programming tools we explore the geometric, algebraic, and computational implications of the presence of discrete symmetries in semidefinite programs. It is shown that symmetry exploitation allows a significant reduction in both matrix size and number of decision variables. The results, reinterpreted from an invariant-theoretic viewpoint, provide a novel representation of a class of nonnegative symmetric polynomials. For this, we introduce a common generalization of sum of squares polynomials and positive semidefinite matrices, termed “sum of squares matrices.” The main theorem states that an invariant sum of squares polynomial is a sum of inner products of pairs of matrices, whose entries are invariant polynomials. In these pairs, one of the matrices is computed based on the real irreducible representations of the group, and the other is a sum of squares matrix. The reduction techniques enable the numerical solution of large-scale instances, otherwise computationally infeasible to solve."
